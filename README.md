Gaussian Extracting: A Lightweight and Interactive  Gaussian Segmentation Method

# Introduction
The recently developed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) stands out as an exceptional approach for visualizing 3D representations, outperforming the Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) in both training time and reconstruction quality. These advantages imply that 3DGS could be of broader use in the fields of 3D comprehension and editing. Meanwhile, 3DGS segmentation methods are still in the nascent stage. We propose an lightweight and interactive 3D Gaussian segmentation pipeline with the ability to easily integrate with any existing trained 2D segmentation model. This integration enhances the accuracy and efficiency of segmenting specific objects from 3D scenes, allowing for rapid and precise object identification. We train a category feature for each Gaussian and concurrently train an MLP decoder to predict the category information of models. Consequently, models of the specified category can be efficiently extracted. In order to solve the problem of artifacts in model segmentation, we use the KNN algorithm to refine the segmentation results and reduce the noise generated in model segmentation. Ultimately, the target object in the 3D scene can be segmented from any designated view-point. The experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can be effectively applied to diverse complex scenes, effectively segmenting 3D models within milliseconds while saving considerable memory without dropping the quality of segmentation results.
